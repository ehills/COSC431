To compile:

flex parse.c
flex -P zz main.c

or if for some reason that fails i have already provided the flex compiled code.

gcc -Wall -pedantic flexarray.c htable.c index.c lex.zz.c lex.yy.c mylib.c search.c -lm -o search

To Index:

./search -i /path/to/wsj

To Search:

./search -s < test_file
or simply enter it at the prompt 

or

./search -v test_file
or enter it at the prompt.
-v will produce output about each individual word in the query. -s will only do the final merged report.
