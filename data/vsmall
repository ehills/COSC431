   John Blair &amp; Co. is close to an agreement to sell its TV station advertising representation operation and program production unit to an investor group led by James H. Rosenfield, a former CBS Inc. executive, industry sources said. 

   Industry sources put the value of the proposed acquisition at more than $100 million. 
John Blair was acquired last year by Reliance Capital Group Inc., which has been divesting itself of John Blair's major assets. 
John Blair represents about 130 local television stations in the placement of national and other advertising. 

   Mr. Rosenfield stepped down as a senior executive vice president of CBS Broadcasting in December 1985 under a CBS early retirement program. 
Neither Mr. Rosenfield nor officials of John Blair could be reached for comment.
